## General info
- Repo created with aim to store code for word count MapReduce task assigned in lab of course CPE 325 Big Data, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi

## Technologies
- Python 3 : programming language
- re : regular expression for text cleaning
- argparse : program argument parser

see this [notebook](https://github.com/ppkgtmm/big-data/blob/main/Lecture%206%20-%20Hadoop%20MapReduce/Exercise.ipynb) if you want to know more about how the code here is used
